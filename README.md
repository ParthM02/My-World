To run this project, you will need either a Simulator on a Mac or an iPhone. This project will not run on android and cannot be converted into an APK without catastrophic failure. It is for these reasons that I have made my iPhone XR the primary device for both testing and demos regarding this project. (You agreed to this condition on the proposal)

To start the app, simply open the app and you will be presented with two buttons, one for started the AR page and another for help and tips. 

When on Help Page: You can view directions and click the “back” button to move back to the home page if the user wants to do so.

When on the AR Page: You can see the selection of notes and sticks that are offered. When clicking on a note cell, a pop-up will appear asking what the user wants to write, with the option to cancel or save. They can also press the back button to leave if the user chooses to. If the user wants to save the current scene in a picture for their camera roll, they can press the picture button.

When on Picture Page: You can view the image as well as press the button to save to the camera roll and it will be saved. If the user doesn’t like the picture, they can click the retake button to go back to the AR Page.
